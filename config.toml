This blog will probably be a lot like other blogs and I will focus mostly on technology blogs with a sprinkle of the below:

DevOps Technologies, Professional Development ideas, Some personal stuff, How I deal with Imposter Symdrome (and yes, I still get it occasionally)

I work as a CI/CD Architect at [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com) as part of the Customer Success team and and I am based just outside of Glasgow, Scotland.

I work with some of Octopus's largest customers and also help write content that help the users of Octopus. This blog holds my own opinions, ideas and content and it won't be part of my work at Octopus.
